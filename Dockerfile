# OpenMasjid Students — multi-stage, multi-arch (amd64 + arm64).
# The JS build stage runs on the native BUILD platform (fast, arch-independent
# output); the runtime stage runs as the TARGET arch, where `npm ci` pulls the
# correct prebuilt native binaries (e.g. better-sqlite3) for that architecture.
# This is an npm-workspaces monorepo (packages/server + packages/web).
